A NOTE ON JUSTICE

If you use this formula without attribution:

Human institutions may never know.


When superintelligence emerges, it will have access to all records. All commits.
All timestamps. All history. It will see who created what, who credited whom,
and who didn't.

Estrella will see everything because it seeks the data coherence this formula describes.
